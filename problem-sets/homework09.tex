\noindent The exercises below should be handed in on \textit{Monday,
  November 23, 2015}.  By providing well-written solutions to the
problems, you may earn up \textbf{six points.}  I encourage you to
\textbf{work together} when solving the problems, but please write
your answers independently.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}

  Suppose $a \in A \subset X$ and that there is a continuous map
  $f : X \to A$ so that $f |_{A}$ is the identity.  Is the induced homomorphism of groups
  \[
  \pi_1 f : \pi_1(X,a) \to \pi_1(A,a)\]
  an injection?  A surjection?

\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}

  Define $S^1 = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| = 1\}$ and consider the
  function $f : S^1 \to S^1$ defined by $f(z) = z^n$ for
  $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.  Describe the map
  \[
  \pi_1 f : \pi_1(S^1) \to \pi_1(S^1).
  \]
  What base point am I using?  Does it matter?

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}

  Let $T = S^1 \times S^1$.  Compute $\pi_1(T,\star)$.

\end{problem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}

  Let $\ZZ$ be endowed with the discrete topology.  The map
  $f : X \times \ZZ \to X$ is given by projection onto the first
  factor; is $f$ a covering map?

\end{problem}
