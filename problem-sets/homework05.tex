\noindent The exercises below should be handed in on \textit{Monday,
  October 5, 2015}.  By providing well-written solutions to the
problems, you may earn up \textbf{six points.}  I encourage you to
\textbf{work together} when solving the problems, but please write
your answers independently and include the names of your
co-conspirators.

\begin{problem}[Products of metric spaces]

Suppose $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ are metric spaces.  Can you provide $X \times Y$ with the structure of a metric space so that the topology induced by the metric on $X \times Y$ is the product topology of $X$ and $Y$?

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Non-metric topology?]
  Find a topological space where the topology is not generated by the open balls of a metric space.  If this is not possible, explain why not.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Replacing metrics with bounded metrics]
  Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space.  Find another metric $d'$
  (generating the same topology on $X$) with the property that
  $d(x,y) \leq 1$ for all $x,y \in X$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Anti-metric spaces]
  An \textbf{antimetric space} $(X,d)$ is just like a metric space (so $d$ is symmetric and positive definite) but instead of the triangle inequality it satisfies the \textbf{anti-triangle inequality}, namely that $d(x,z) > d(x,y) + d(y,z)$ for all $x,y,z \in X$.

  Find (if possible) a couple examples of antimetric spaces.
\end{problem}
