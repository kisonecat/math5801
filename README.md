# Math 5801: General Topology and Knot Theory

In topology, we study geometric objects with an emphasis not so much
on the size of things, but rather on those properties of spaces which
are preserved under continuous deformations.

In this course in particular, we focus on:

- **general topology** or “point-set topology” which establishes the
  foundations of metric spaces and topological spaces and the
  so-called big C’s of continuity, convergence, connected- ness,
  compactness, countability; and
- **knot theory** which studies embeddings of circles in
  three-dimensional space through com- binatorial, geometric, and
  algebraic techniques and invariants.

This course is a *fast-moving* journey through point-set topology,
suitable for someone who has had some experience with a proof-based
math course and is ready to dive into some naïve set theory today.
